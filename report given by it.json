Each method performs its intended function correctly.\n\n### Security Issues\nThe class includes input validation that raises `ValueError` for non-numeric inputs, which is a good practice. However, it is recommended to log these exceptions for better traceability in production environments.\n\n### Suggestions\n- **Type Hints**: Adding type hints to method signatures would improve readability and facilitate type checking.\n- **Documentation**: Expanding docstrings to include parameter types and return types would enhance clarity.\n- **Unit Tests**: Implementing unit tests for each method is advisable to ensure correctness and support future changes.\n\n### Performance\nThe operations are efficient for basic arithmetic, and no performance issues were detected.\n\n### Architecture\nThe class adheres to the single responsibility principle by focusing solely on arithmetic operations. For future extensibility, consider implementing an interface or abstract base class if more complex operations are planned."
